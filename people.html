        <p style="font-size:1.5rem"; class = "text-justify">I was born in Baghlan, Afghanistan, but as a child I grew up in Peshawar, Pakistan. I arrived in the UK in 2008 and went to school in north west London. I then went to the University of Reading to study for an MChem degree. My final year project was on the synthesis of photocaged neurotransmitters, supervised by Dr Christopher Smith. During my Undergraduate studies I also undertook another 8-week summer research project, metal-free aryne mediated C-H bond activation, under the supervision of Dr Christopher jones, at QMUL. For this I was awarded the “RSC Summer UGBursary 2019”. During my undergraduate studies, I was also awarded the organic practical and Edward Guggenheim prize. I am now working on prebiotic peptide ligation for my PhD in mwp group. In my free time I enjoy cooking, running, and going to the gym.</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.5rem" class = "text-justify">My name is Arran, and I come from a village called Angmering in West Sussex. I did a four year integrated masters in Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in Chemistry. I was at Christ’s College, which was attended by Charles Darwin; here I am pictured sitting in his chair. Throughout my undergrad, I was interested in how chemical processes gave rise to living systems. This led me to focus on organic chemistry and its application to biology, and then to apply for a PhD in the Powner Lab. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, cooking, and the occasional trip to the pub.</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.5rem" class = "text-justify">After growing up near Dundee (Scotland), Andrew moved southwards to undertake his MChem at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 2020. While at Edinburgh he undertook projects in the Lloyd-Jones, Cockroft and Thomas groups, work in the latter of which on iron-catalysed B₂pin₂ deuterogenolysis has been published. His final year MChem project on nickel-catalysed Heck reactions was performed under the supervision of Prof. Snyder at the University of Chicago. His work in the Powner group is currently focused on prebiotic cobalt catalysed reactions. In his spare time he would go to the pub or think about where he might next go on holiday, but instead he stays home and watches Netflix, reads the news obsessively, cooks, eats, and sleeps. It’s like Groundhog Day (a film Andrew has seen), but less funny.</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.5rem" class = "text-justify">Shane grew up in Waterford, a small historical city in the southeast of Ireland. He read Chemical Sciences at Trinity College Dublin, specialising in Medicinal Chemistry. He carried out his Capstone Project on the total synthesis of natural products in the Lawrence Group at the University of Edinburgh via an Erasmus+ Traineeship. For this work, he was awarded the Cocker Prize in Chemistry at Trinity. He has undertaken industrial placements at Sanofi and Bausch + Lomb, respectively. His research in the Powner Lab is currently focused on prebiotic phosphorylation reactions. He is passionate about education equality and STEM outreach and enjoys working in these areas. In his spare time, Shane is trying to identify London’s finest pint of Guinness!</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.5rem" class = "text-justify">I’m Emily and I grew up in Waterford, in the “Sunny South-East” of Ireland. I completed my four year undergraduate degree in Chemistry of Pharmaceutical Compounds at University College Cork. During this time, I completed a five month internship as a chemist at Merck Sharpe and Dohme (MSD). My final year research project explored the potential of enantioselective copper bis(oxazoline) catalysts in intermolecular C-H insertion. My project aims to build on our knowledge of Catalytic Peptide Ligation (CPL). With this in mind, we aim to advance our understanding of the origins of the central dogma of molecular biology and develop a novel methodology for orthogonally controlled organocatalytic synthesis of peptides and nucleic acids in water. Outside of the lab I enjoy running, baking, and going out with friends.</p>
